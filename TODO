DONE:
- Choose rendering library - SDL3

TODO:
- finish textures and textfields
- make UI in -1 to 1 range coordinates
- make tiling UI mode (like slicing the elements in x%
 vertically or horizontally and rendering on the halves that also can be cut)
- source code view
- breakpoints
- variables at breakpoint
- live view of variables (maybe at a "snapshot" line)
