DONE:
- Choose rendering library - SDL3

TODO:
- make a name (define or simmilar) for bounds = vec4(x,y,w,h)
- make a name (define or simmilar) for colors = vec4(r,g,b,a)
- CHOOSE coordinates: -1...1 centered, 0...1 just normalized (I think just normalized)
- make the rendering fully static (take a list in the renderer of all the elements and render them all in a funtion
so we can use a global renderer state, for buttons or simmilar use callback or something, maybe use classes for
elements so the list  will be of base element and text, button... will be subclasses)
- all code TODO: comments
- finish textures and textfields
- make UI in -1 to 1 range coordinates
- make tiling UI mode (like slicing the elements in x%
 vertically or horizontally and rendering on the halves that also can be cut)
- source code view
- breakpoints
- variables at breakpoint
- live view of variables (maybe at a "snapshot" line)
