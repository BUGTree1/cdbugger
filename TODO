DONE:
- Choose rendering library - SDL3
- namespace CDBugger
- Color wrapper class
- Bounds wrapper class
- make the rendering fully static (take a list in the renderer of all the elements and render them all in a funtion
so we can use a global renderer state, for buttons or simmilar use callback or something, maybe use classes for
elements so the list  will be of base element and text, button... will be subclasses)

TODO:
- make coordinates:  0...1 normalized
- make tiling UI mode (UI_VSlice and UI_HSlice that slice a Bounds by some percent and put other UI_Elements there)
- make textfields
- Test on two monitors opening at mouse point
- Should we ASSERT_SDL(TTF_SetTextWrapWidth(text, text_bounds.z)?
- wierd crisp font when different Absolute_positions
- source code view
- breakpoints
- variables at breakpoint
- live view of variables (maybe at a "snapshot" line)

NOTE:
- UNITY has cool ui canvas anchors (https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@2.0/manual/UIBasicLayout.html)
