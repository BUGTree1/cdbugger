DONE:
- Choose rendering library - SDL3
- namespace CDBugger
- Color wrapper class
- Bounds wrapper class
- make the rendering fully static (take a list in the renderer of all the elements and render them all in a funtion
so we can use a global renderer state, for buttons or simmilar use callback or something, maybe use classes for
elements so the list  will be of base element and text, button... will be subclasses)

TODO:
- make coordinates:  0...1 normalized
- all code TODO: comments
- finish textures and textfields
- make UI in -1 to 1 range coordinates
- make tiling UI mode (like slicing the elements in x%
 vertically or horizontally and rendering on the halves that also can be cut)
- source code view
- breakpoints
- variables at breakpoint
- live view of variables (maybe at a "snapshot" line)
